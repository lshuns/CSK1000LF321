# Perform cosmological inference

It relies on the [CosmoSIS](https://cosmosis.readthedocs.io) code

The various folders contain different configurations for the robustness tests, as explained in Section 5 of the paper.

The fiducial configuration is in [LF321_polychord_nIA](https://github.com/lshuns/CSK1000LF321/tree/main/E_Cosmology/LF321_polychord_nIA)

[Z_S8shift_due2m](https://github.com/lshuns/CSK1000LF321/tree/main/E_Cosmology/Z_S8shift_due2m) contains code used to evaluate the shift in S8 caused by residual shear biases, as explained in Appendix C of the paper.
